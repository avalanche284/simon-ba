          I started this project as a way of learning <mark>networking</mark>. I have always wanted to have a NAS server up and running by myself. After a course at the University I bought necessary componenets, built the computer and set up the NAS. After that I was also using it as a machine to virtualize systems as the TrueNAS OS has this capability.
