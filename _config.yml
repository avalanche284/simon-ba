          I started this project as a way of learning <mark>networking</mark>. I have always wanted a NAS server up and running by myself. After a course at the University, I bought the necessary components, built the computer and set up the NAS. After that, I also used it as a machine to virtualize systems, as the TrueNAS OS has this capability.

          I started working on it as my dream o having an Apple machine. Then, inspired by a friend, I bought the necessary additions to my old computer, read a lot of threads on specific forums, and finally set up and run Hackintosh. Of course, not all things were working, but this experience gave me incredible fun by fixing errors coming while working on it. Through this course, I learned the basics of working using <mark>Bash</mark> and <mark>CMD</mark>.
